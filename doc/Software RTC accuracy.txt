Software RTC
============

Since this project modifies the NMEA sentences it receives, it only sends out
time updates when they are being received. For GPS receivers this occurs every
second or every other second, but for devices like the PV Electronics WiFi NTP
Sync Device, this occurs every 3271 seconds.

Therefore, and in case of signal loss, it would be de preferable to send out a
spontaneous update after switching to or from daylight saving time.

To achieve this, an on-board RTC in required to keep track of time in between
updates. Unfortunately, the PIC16F15325 does not have such a peripheral. The
next best alternative would be to have an 32.768kHz crystal drive one of the
internal timers, but driving a crystal is hard and crystals are expensive.

Alternatively, the internal HF oscillator ()LFINTOSC is specified as being
high-precision factory calibrated with a +/- 1MHz typical accuraty. On top of
that, it can be tuned to frequency using the HFTUNE register. Having an
external reference sending NMEA time updates every 3271 seconds perfectly
allows software to tune the internal oscillator to an exact fequecy.

Unfortunately, the internal HF oscillator is not stable enough and the tuning
granularity is not fine enough to be used as an RTC. As the log below shows,
deviations of (well) over a second over a period of almost an hour (54:31)
are not uncommon. The tuning algoritm coulde be better though: Value 6 is
showing potential, but with values 6 and 7 differing over 2 seconds, other
circumstances may not have a value that close to 0.
